            <h2>Fun Fact: Driving on the left side of the road</h2>
            <p>England's left-side driving is that it dates back to medieval times when knights and horseback riders would keep to the left to leave their right hand free for wielding a sword.</p>
            <p>This practice was officially sanctioned in 1300 AD when Pope Boniface VIII declared that all pilgrims travelling to Rome should keep to the left.</p>
